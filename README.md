## Overview
- Stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. The given dataset can be used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, bmi value, various diseases, and smoking status.
## Built using:
- [Scikit Learn: ](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) ML Library used
- [TensorFlow Keras: ](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras) ML Libraries used
- [HTML: ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) HTML documentation used
- [Javscript: ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) Javscript framework used
- [Pandas: ](https://pandas.pydata.org/) Python data manipulation libraries
- [Seaborn: ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) Data visualisation library
